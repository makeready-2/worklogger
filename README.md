# WorkLogger

Time-limited exercise to build a clock-in/clock-out web app within 48 hours.
Available at https://worklogger-gw.herokuapp.com/

### Approach

Rather than trying to implement as many vanilla-Rails CRUD features as I had time for, I focused my time on implementing React + Redux + React Router.

Frontend features
* Entirely SPA
* Functional style React+Redux
* Routing is mostly delegated to the frontend
* Monospace layout for those who miss typewriters

Backend features
* Roles system (unused at present)
* Devise sessions/registrations handled via API (JSON) controllers

### Next steps

Features
* Edit existing WorkLogs - if the user is not Admin, the changes would be written to work_log.pending_edits until the user's supervisor reviews and approves the changes.
* Review pending edits (for supervisors and admins)
* Edit profile
* Select supervisor from list of supervisors when registering, and in profile edit page
* Reports - visualise a single employee's work history or an entire team's
* Audit trails

Frontend technology
* Show times in local zone
* Fix js console warnings regarding controlled vs uncontrolled form inputs
* Jest tests for all components, reducers, and actions. All JS objects in the project are unit-testable without having to spin up a phantom browser.
* Paginate + prettify work log history
* Current time + time clocked in should be dynamically rendered (tick as you watch)
* Better UI feedback (button loading states, loading transition effects)
* Prevent new clock-in and redirect to edit page if an existing work_log hasn't been completed yet
* Auto clock-in on login (user-configurable setting)
* Cleaner CSS structure (extract reused layout attributes to shareable objects)
* Better CSS framework (SCSS / PostCSS)
* Better post-action message system (right now it's a Frankenstein's monster of alert()s and component props)

Backend technology
* Proper state machine and audit trail for work logs using the `aasm` + `paper_trail` gems.
* Reenable CSRF protection and get Devise working over the API without leaving this security hole open
* Most of the Ruby in the repo was autogenerated. Add tests for anything that was customized especially tests for the Devise hacks.
* Devise was actually way too heavyweight here - most of it is unused. Look into a simpler implementation of bcrypt instead.

Development / Deployment
* Run unit tests / Rubocop as post-commit / pre-deploy step
* Set up proper Rubocop config (right now scans everything including js and autogenerated rails files)
* Set up eslint stage for js code style
* Implement and run a small suite of phantom browser tests covering critical paths, as a post-commit / pre-deploy step. 

### Using this repo locally

After cloning, all you have to do is create the db and seed the initial data.
```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s
```
The server will be available at localhost:3000.
